# Blackhole vs Galaxy Image Classifier
A project that uses Convolution Neural Networks(CNNs) to classify astronomical images as blackholes or galaxies built with Tensorflow/Keras.This project combines computer science with astrophysics and is inspired by the wonders of space.

## Dataset
The model has been trained from the Kaggle datset mentioned below:
